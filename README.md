# EfficientDet-Pytorch
EfficientDet implementation for object detection in Pytorch. EfficientNet as backbone.

BiFPN and Modified BiFPN.

effcientNet backbones from https://github.com/lukemelas/EfficientNet-PyTorch

### BiFPN

* Pytorch implementation of BiFPN as described in [EfficientDet: Scalable and Efficient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09070)  by 
Mingxing Tan, Ruoming Pang, Quoc V. Le
* Few changes were made to original BiFPN.
* Added extra convolution layer for each input feature map.
